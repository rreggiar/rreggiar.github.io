  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Early detection of pancreatic cancer (PaC) can drastically improve survival rates. Approximately 25\% of subjects with PaC have type 2 diabetes diagnosed within 3 years prior to the PaC diagnosis, suggesting that subjects with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of occult PaC. We have developed an early-detection PaC test, based on changes in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) signals in cell-free DNA from plasma. METHODS: Blood was collected from 132 subjects with PaC and 528 noncancer subjects to generate epigenomic and genomic feature sets yielding a predictive PaC signal algorithm. The algorithm was validated in a blinded cohort composed of 102 subjects with PaC, 2048 noncancer subjects, and 1524 subjects with non-PaCs. RESULTS: 5hmC differential profiling and additional genomic features enabled the development of a machine learning algorithm capable of distinguishing subjects with PaC from noncancer subjects with high specificity and sensitivity. The algorithm was validated with a sensitivity for early-stage (stage I/II) PaC of 68.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 51.9\%-81.9\%) and an overall specificity of 96.9\% (95\% CI, 96.1\%-97.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: The PaC detection test showed robust early-stage detection of PaC signal in the studied cohorts with varying type 2 diabetes status. This assay merits further clinical validation for the early detection of PaC in high-risk individuals.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) are actively secreted from cells in membrane-bound extracellular vesicles (EVs). Diverse classes of RNAs are secreted as exRNAs, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and transposable element RNAs (TE RNAs). However, the full composition and clinical utility of exRNAs secreted in response to oncogenic signaling are unknown. Here we use both affinity- and nanofiltration-based EV isolation approaches to show that mutant KRAS(G12C) signaling results in the secretion of specific lncRNAs, TE RNAs, and mRNAs, some of which are prognostic for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patient survival. We found that inhibition of KRAS(G12C) signaling broadly reprograms the noncoding transcriptome, as evidenced by a substantial increase in TE RNA secretion. KRAS(G12C) inhibition also increased the abundance of secreted lncRNAs and retained intron-containing transcripts, while decreasing the mRNA content of EVs. Oncogenic KRAS(G12C) signaling was required for the secretion of mRNAs from a set of 20 genes that are significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in LUAD. Our study suggests that both coding and noncoding RNAs that are secreted in EVs may serve as KRAS(G12C)-specific signatures for diagnosing lung cancer.},

To test the hypothesis that               cis               -regulatory elements that control fate decisions for all lineages are primed in HSCs, we used ATAC-seq to compare chromatin accessibility of HSCs with five unipotent cell types. We observed the highest similarity in accessibility profiles between megakaryocyte progenitors and HSCs, whereas B cells had the greatest number of regions with de novo gain in accessibility during differentiation. Despite these differences, we identified               cis               -regulatory elements from all lineages that displayed epigenetic priming in HSCs. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of stem cell multipotency, as well as a resource to identify functional drivers of lineage fate.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Epigenetic mechanisms regulate the multilineage differentiation capacity of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into a variety of blood and immune cells. Mapping the chromatin dynamics of functionally defined cell populations will shed mechanistic insight into 2 major, unanswered questions in stem cell biology: how does epigenetic identity contribute to a cell type's lineage potential, and how do cascades of chromatin remodeling dictate ensuing fate decisions? Our recent work revealed evidence of multilineage gene priming in HSCs, where open cis-regulatory elements (CREs) exclusively shared between HSCs and unipotent lineage cells were enriched for DNA binding motifs of known lineage-specific transcription factors. Oligopotent progenitor populations operating between the HSCs and unipotent cells play essential roles in effecting hematopoietic homeostasis. To test the hypothesis that selective HSC-primed lineage-specific CREs remain accessible throughout differentiation, we used ATAC-seq to map the temporal dynamics of chromatin remodeling during progenitor differentiation. We observed epigenetic-driven clustering of oligopotent and unipotent progenitors into distinct erythromyeloid and lymphoid branches, with multipotent HSCs and MPPs associating with the erythromyeloid lineage. We mapped the dynamics of lineage-primed CREs throughout hematopoiesis and identified both unique and shared CREs as potential lineage reinforcement mechanisms at fate branch points. Additionally, quantification of genome-wide peak count and size revealed overall greater chromatin accessibility in HSCs, allowing us to identify HSC-unique peaks as putative regulators of self-renewal and multilineage potential. Finally, CRISPRi-mediated targeting of ATACseq-identified putative CREs in HSCs allowed us to demonstrate the functional role of selective CREs in lineage-specific gene expression. These findings provide insight into the regulation of stem cell multipotency and lineage commitment throughout hematopoiesis and serve as a resource to test functional drivers of hematopoietic lineage fate.},

  abstract = {RAS genes are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in cancer, yet the effects of oncogenic RAS signaling on the noncoding transcriptome remain unclear. We analyzed the transcriptomes of human airway and bronchial epithelial cells transformed with mutant KRAS to define the landscape of KRAS-regulated noncoding RNAs. We find that oncogenic KRAS signaling upregulates noncoding transcripts throughout the genome, many of which arise from transposable elements (TEs). These TE RNAs exhibit differential expression, are preferentially released in extracellular vesicles, and are regulated by KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) genes, which are broadly downregulated in mutant KRAS cells and lung adenocarcinomas in~vivo. Moreover, mutant KRAS induces an intrinsic IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature that is often seen across many different cancers. Our results indicate that mutant KRAS remodels the repetitive noncoding transcriptome, demonstrating the broad scope of intracellular and extracellular RNAs regulated by this oncogenic signaling pathway.},

Although well-annotated coding and non-coding transcripts in blood are readily detectable and can serve as biomarkers of disease, the overall diagnostic utility of the cell-free transcriptome remains unclear. Here we show that RNAs derived from transposable elements and other repeat elements are enriched in the cell-free transcriptome of patients with cancer, and that they serve as signatures for the accurate classification of the disease. We used repeat-element-aware liquid-biopsy technology and single-molecule nanopore sequencing to profile the cell-free transcriptome in plasma from patients with cancer and to examine millions of genomic features comprising all annotated genes and repeat elements throughout the genome. By aggregating individual repeat elements to the subfamily level, we found that samples with pancreatic cancer are enriched with specific Alu subfamilies, whereas other cancers have their own characteristic cell-free RNA profile. Our findings show that repetitive RNA sequences are abundant in blood and can be used as disease-specific diagnostic biomarkers.},
