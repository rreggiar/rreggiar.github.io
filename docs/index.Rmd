## News

2022-08 -- I just wrapped up teaching the 2022 UCSC Genomics Institute Summer Short Course in Bioinformatics, check out the course material and website [here](https://rreggiar.github.io/ucsc_scbc_2022/).

2022-07 -- Our work on mutant KRAS-driven epigenomic changes in early tumorigenesis is out now [published  in *Cell Reports*!](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)00906-8)


## Bio

Hello! I'm finishing my PhD in Bioengineering and Bionformatics at UC Santa Cruz
under supervision of Assistant Professor Daniel Kim. I am an **NIH F99/K00 fellow
supported by the NIDDK-KUH** to complete my thesis work (F99) developing novel RNA 
liquid biopsies for the non-invasive detection and characterization of Lung and 
Pancreatic cancers and have an additional (K00) 4-years of funding to expand 
extracellular RNA research into hematological applications. 

In addition to my academic training, I have also **interned with (and currently consult for) 
Bluestar Genomics**, one of the leaders in commercial liquid biopsy technology.

My expertise is in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/statistics -- techniques
I have used to help advance academic (RNA) and industrial (DNA) liquid biopsy 
approaches. 

I'll soon be seeking Post Doctoral positions that enable my 
K00-supported research and my continued growth as a scientist, mentor, and human.

Summer 2022 I'll be running a UCSC Genomics Institute-sponsored Bioinformatics 
Short-course for primarily Community College students and 
writing a report as a Baskin Engineering Anti-Racist Research fellow.

Additionally, I'll be deciding on the destination for my post-doc.
