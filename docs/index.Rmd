## Bio

Hello! I'm finishing my PhD in Bioengineering and Bionformatics at UC Santa Cruz
under supervision of Assistant Professor Daniel Kim. I am an **NIH F99/K00 fellow
supported by the NIDDK-KUH** to complete my thesis work (F99) developing novel RNA 
liquid biopsies for the non-invasive detection and characterization of Lung and 
Pancreatic cancers and have an additional (K00) 4-years of funding to expand 
extracellular RNA research into hematological applications. In addition to my 
academic training, I have also **interned with (and currenty consult for) 
Bluestar Genomics**, one of the leaders in commercial liquid biopsy technology. My
expertise is in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/statistics -- techniques
I have used to help advance academic (RNA) and industrial (DNA) liquid biopsy 
approaches. 

I'll soon be seeking Post Doctoral positions that enable my 
K00-supported research and my continued growth as a scientist, mentor, and human.
