# an introduction
So, why am I making posts here even though I never post anywhere else, almost hope no-one ever reads this, and am unsure of what to cover? I've begun to chafe against the long silences in between publications and, now that I'm teaching less in my post-doc, I want to be able to keep communicating and working through thoughts somewhere. I'm going to try and read+review some publications, maybe pre-prints, and post write-ups here? I have some side-quest post ideas like math-ing the optimal approaches to my new favorite board game *Azul* and thinking through some of the biology I'm exploring in an open manner. Also, and yes I'm so original, I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head about LLM-assisted coding -- it helped me build this site, and it enabling quite a bit of computational exploration on my end. I don't have moral clarity about the technology and maybe its better to actually try and write through that?
