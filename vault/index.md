trying to build a better future with biology and computers (and occasionally [soap dispensers](https://wonderfil.world))

now: RNA engineering and mechanism @ [Stanford RNA Medicine Program](https://www.stanfordrnamedicine.com) with Will Greenleaf (fmr: Howard Chang, now at Amgen)

- coming soon: building better RNAs and figuring out why they work

then: liquid biopsy @ UC Santa Cruz (extracellular RNA) and ClearNote (5-hydroxymethylated DNA)

- [ancient, repetitive RNA is abundant and potentially diagnostic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01081-7)
- [Epigenomic Blood-Based Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Employing Cell-Free DNA](https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565%2823%2900224-0/fulltext)
at the beginning:
- [mutant KRAS leads to remarkable regulatory overhaul in lung cancer](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)00906-8?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email)
  - coming soon: so does treatment
