# Hello, I'm Roman

I'm a scientist trying to build a better future with biology and computers (and occasionally [soap dispensers](https://wonderfil.world)).

I'm currently engineering RNA and delving into the mechanisms that make them work as molecular and therapeutic tools @ [Stanford RNA Medicine Program](https://www.stanfordrnamedicine.com) with Will Greenleaf (fmr: Howard Chang, now at Amgen).

Honored to be supported by a life-altering NIH NIDDK F99/K00 award.

During my PhD, I built a liquid biopsy technology @ UC Santa Cruz using repetitive extracellular RNA and contributed to liquid biopsy tech development @ ClearNote health using 5-hydroxymethylated DNA circulating in blood plasma.
