    "text": "Summary\nI am an NIH K00 fellow supported by the NIDDK-KUH in Howard Chang’s lab at Stanford University.\nI earned my PhD under the supervision of Asst. Professor Daniel Kim at UCSC where I focused on developing a cell-free, repeat-aware RNA liquid biopsy. In addition to my academic training I also interned with ClearNote Health (fmr: Bluestar Genomics), one of the leaders in commercial liquid biopsy technology.\nMy expertise is in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/statistics – techniques I have used to help advance academic (RNA) and industrial (DNA) liquid biopsy approaches."
