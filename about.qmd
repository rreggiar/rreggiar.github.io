## Summary

I'm finishing my PhD in Biomolecular Engineering and Bionformatics at UC Santa Cruz
under supervision of Assistant Professor Daniel Kim. I am an **NIH F99/K00 fellow
supported by the NIDDK-KUH** to complete my thesis work (F99) developing novel RNA 
liquid biopsies for the non-invasive detection and characterization of Lung and 
Pancreatic cancers and have an additional (K00) 4-years of funding to expand 
my research platform under a soon-to-be-announced advisor at Stanford University

In addition to my academic training, I have also **interned with ClearNote Health (fmr: Bluestar Genomics)**, one of the leaders in commercial liquid biopsy technology.

My expertise is in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/statistics -- techniques
I have used to help advance academic (RNA) and industrial (DNA) liquid biopsy 
approaches. 

Summer 2023 I'll be back to overseeing a UCSC Genomics Institute-sponsored Bioinformatics 
Short-course for primarily Community College students.
