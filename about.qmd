## Summary

I am an **NIH K00 fellow supported by the NIDDK-KUH** in Howard Chang's lab at Stanford University.

I earned my PhD under the supervision of Asst. Professor Daniel Kim at UCSC
where I focused on developing a cell-free, repeat-aware RNA liquid biopsy.
In addition to my academic training I also **interned with ClearNote Health (fmr: Bluestar Genomics)**, 
one of the leaders in commercial liquid biopsy technology.

My expertise is in bioinformatics and applied machine learning/statistics -- techniques
I have used to help advance academic (RNA) and industrial (DNA) liquid biopsy 
approaches.
